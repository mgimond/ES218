## Introduction

Data tables come in different sizes and shape; they can be a very simple two column dataset or they can consist of many columns and "sub-columns". Understanding its structure, and learning how to reshape it into a workable form is critical to an effective and error free analysis.

For example, a median earnings data table downloaded from the U.S. census bureau's website might look something like this:

![](img/Typical_table.png)

We are conditioned to think of a table as consisting of three components: rows, columns and data values. Implicit in this paradigm is that each column represents a unique attribute. However, this may not always be the case. For example, in the above table, each column represents two distinct variables: gender and educational attainment (two distinct sets of attributes).

![](img/Anatomy_of_a_census_table.png)

Another way of describing a dataset is by defining its **variable(s)**, **values** and **observations**. In the above example, we have four variables: gender, education, region and income. Each variable consists of either categorical values (e.g. region, gender and education) or numerical values (income). 

An observation consists of a **unique set** of attribute **values**. For example the values `West Region`, `Female`, `Graduate` and `$57,914` make up **one** observation: there is just one instance of these combined values in the data. This perspective affords us another option in presenting the dataset: we can assign each column its own variable, and each row its own observation.

Note that each row of the table is part of a unique set of variable attributes. A dataset in this format may not be human "readable" (unlike its *wide* counterpart), but is the format of choice for many data analysis and visualization operations.

The next sections will demonstrate how one can convert a wide format to a long format and *vice versa*.

## Wide and long table formats

A 2014 Boston (Logan airport) flight data summary table will be used in this exercise. The summary displays average mean delay time (in minutes) by day of the work week and quarter. 

```{r tidy=FALSE}

df <- data.frame( Weekday = c( "Mon", "Tues", "Wed", "Thurs", "Fri" ),
                  Q1      = c(  9.9 ,  4.9	,  8.8 ,   12.2 ,  12.2 ),
                  Q2      = c(  5.4	,  9.7  , 11.1 ,   10.2 ,   8.1 ),
                  Q3      = c(  8.8 ,  7.9  , 10.2 ,   9.2  ,   7.9 ),
                  Q4      = c(  6.9 ,    5  ,  9.3 ,   9.7  ,   5.6 ) )
```

Reshaping a table involves modifying its layout (or "shape"). In our example, `df` is in a "wide" format.

```{r}
df
```

There are three unique variables: day of week, quarter of year, and mean departure delay.

### Creating a long table from a wide table

A package that facilitates converting from wide to long (and *vice versa*)  is `tidyr`. To go from wide to long we use the `pivot_longer` function. Note that if you are using a version of `tidyr` older than `1.0` you will want to use the  `gather()` function..

The `pivot_longer` function takes three arguments: 

 * `cols`: list of columns that are to be collapsed. The columns can be referenced by column number or column name.
 * `names_to`: This is the name of the new column which will combine all column names (e.g. `Q1`, `Q2`, `Q3` and `Q4`).
 * `values_to`: This is the name of the new column which will combine all column values (e.g. average delay times) associated with each variable combination.
 
In our example, the line of code needed to re-express the table into a long form can be written in at least one of four ways:
 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyr)
df.long <- pivot_longer(df, cols=2:5, names_to = "Quarter", values_to = "Delay")
# or
df.long <- pivot_longer(df, cols=-1, names_to = "Quarter", values_to = "Delay")
# or
df.long <- pivot_longer(df, cols=Q1:Q4, names_to = "Quarter", values_to = "Delay")
# or
df.long <- pivot_longer(df, cols=c(Q1,Q2,Q3,Q4), names_to = "Quarter", values_to = "Delay")
```

All four lines produce the same output, they differ only by how we are referencing the columns that are to be collapsed. Note that we assigned the names `Quarter` and `Delay` to the two new columns.

The first 10 lines of the output table are shown here. Note how each `Delay` value has its own row.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(tidyr)
df.long <- gather(df, key = "Quarter", value = "Delay" , Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 )
head(df.long, 10)
```

The following figure summarizes the wide to long conversion.

### Creating a wide table from a long table

If a table is to be used for a visual assessment of the values, a long format may be difficult to work with. A long table can be re-expressed into a wide form by picking the two variables that will define the new column names and values.

Continuing with our example, we will convert `df.long` back to a wide format  using the `pivot_wider()` function. This replaces the `spread()` function from earlier versions of tidyr (`<1.0`). The `pivot_wider()` function takes at least two arguments:

 * `names_from`: Variable whose values will be converted to column names.
 * `values_from`: Variable whose values will populate the table’s block of cell values.

```{r}
df.wide <- pivot_wider(df.long, names_from = Quarter, values_from = Delay) 
```

We've now recreated the wide version of our table.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
head(df.wide, 10)
```

The following figure summarizes the long to wide conversion.

## Advanced `pivot_longer` options

Here’s a subset of median income by sex and by work experience for 2017.

```{r}
df2 <- data.frame(state = c("Maine", "Massachusetts", 
                             "New Hampshire", "Vermont"),
                   male_fulltime = c(50329,66066, 59962, 50530), 
                   male_other = c(18099, 18574, 20274, 17709), 
                   female_fulltime = c(40054, 53841, 46178, 42198),
                   female_other = c(13781, 14981, 15121, 14422))
df2
```

At first glance, it might seem that we have three variables as in the earlier example, but upon closer examination, we see that we can tease out two variables from the column names: sex (`male` and `female`) and work experience (`fulltime` and `other`).

<img src="img/double_header.PNG" style="width: 73%; height: auto;">

`pivot_longer` has an argument, `names_sep`, that is passed the character that is used to delimit the two variable values. In our example, this character is `_`. Since the column values will be split across two variables we will also need to pass **two** column names to the `names_to` argument.

<img src="img/long_to_separate_wide.PNG" style="width: 73%; height: auto;">

```{r}
df2.long <- pivot_longer(df2, cols = -state, 
                         names_to = c("sex","work"), 
                         names_sep = "_", 
                         values_to = "income")
df2.long
``` 

 

## Advanced `pivot_wider` options
&nbsp;

### Combining variable names when spreading 

Continuing with the `df2.long` dataframe, we can spread the long table back to a wide table while combining the `sex` and `work` variables. We'll add the `names_sep` argument which defines the character to use to separate the two variable names. We'll use a dot `.` separator in this example.

```{r}
pivot_wider(df2.long, 
            names_from = c(sex,work), 
            values_from = income,
            names_sep = ".")
``` 


### Spreading duplicate variable combinations

If your long table has more than one unique combination of variables, `pivot_wider()` will return a list. Note that if you have used the older version of `tidyr` (version `<1.0`)  its  `spread()` function  would have returned an error.

```{r}
df3 <- data.frame(var1 = c("a", "a", "b", "b"),
                  var2 = c("x", "x", "y", "y"),
                  val  = c(5,3,1,4))
df3
```

```{r error=TRUE}
pivot_wider(df3, names_from = var2, values_from = val)
```

Since the intersections of `a`:`x`  and `b`:`y` each have two possible values, the function returns a *list* of values. Assuming that the duplicate records are not an erroneous entry, you will need to instruct the function on how to summarize the multiple values using the `values_fn` argument. For example, to return  the maximum value, type:

```{r error=TRUE}
pivot_wider(df3, 
            names_from = var2, 
            values_from = val, 
            values_fn = list(val = min))
```

You'll note the empty cells resulting from there not being a valid combination for `a`:`y` and `b`:`x`. You can specify the missing values using the `values_fill` argument. For example, to replace `NA` with `0` type:

```{r error=TRUE}
pivot_wider(df3, names_from = var2, values_from = val, 
            values_fn   = list(val = min),
            values_fill = list(val = 0))
```

## Additional manipulation options

The `tidyr` package offers other functions not directly tied to pivoting. Some of these functions are highlihghted next.

### Separating elements in one column into separate columns

To split a column into two or more columns based on a existing column's delimited value, use the `separate()` function.

```{r}
# Let's first create a delimited table
df2.long <- pivot_longer(df2, cols = -1, 
                         names_to = "var1", 
                         values_to = "income")
df2.long

# Split var1 column into two columns
df2.sep <- separate(df2.long, 
                    col = var1, 
                    sep = "_", 
                    into = c("sex", "work"))
df2.sep
```

### Splitting rows into multiple rows based on delimited values

To split delimited values across rows, use the `separate_rows` function.

```{r}
separate_rows(df2.long, var1, sep = "_")
```

Note that the output is a `tibble` even if the input is a dataframe. 

### Replicate rows by count

You can expand rows based on a count column using the `uncount()` function. This is the opposite of a `group_by(...) %>% count()` operation that tallies up the observations based on a grouping variable. Here, we'll replicate rows based on the column `count` value.

```{r}
df2b <- data.frame(var1 = c("a", "b"), 
                   var2 = c("x", "y"), 
                   count = c(1, 3))

df2b
uncount(df2b, count)
```

If you want to add an index column that identifies the replicated rows, add an `.id` argument.

```{r}
uncount(df2b, count, .id = "id")
```


### Combining elements from many columns into a single column

Another practical function in the `tidyr` package is `unite()`. It combines columns into a single column by chaining the contents of the combined columns. For example, the following table has hours, minutes and seconds in separate columns.

```{r}
df <- data.frame(
      Index = c(1,   2,  3),
      Hour  = c(2,  14, 20),
      Min   = c(34,  2, 55),
      Sec   = c(55, 17, 23))

df
```

To combine the three time elements into a single column, type:

```{r}
df2 <- unite(df,  col = Time, c(Hour, Min, Sec) , sep=":", remove =TRUE)
df2
```

The `col` parameter defines the new column name; the parameter `c(Hour, Min, Sec)` defines the columns to be combined into column `Time`; `sep=":"` tells the function what characters are to be used to separate the elements (here, we are separating the time elements using `:`); `remove=TRUE` tells the function to remove columns two through four.

### Creating unique combinations of variable values

You can use `expand_grid` to automatically generate a table with unique combinations of a set of variable values. For example, to fill a table with a combination of student names and homework assignments, type:

```{r}
df3.long <- expand_grid(
  student    = c("Joe", "Jane", "Kim"),  # Define all unique student names
  assignment = c(paste0("HW", 1:4)),     # Define all unique HW assignments
  value      = NA)
df3.long
```

We can then create a wide version of the table using `pivot_wider`. 

```{r}
pivot_wider(df3.long, names_from = assignment, values_from = value)
```

### Expanding table with missing sets of values

It's not uncommon to be handed a table with incomplete combinations of observations. For example, the following table gives us yield and data source values for each combination of year and grain type. However, several combinations of year/grain are missing.

```{r}
df4.long <- data.frame( Year  = c(1999,1999,2000,2000,2001,2003,2003,2005),
                        Grain = c("Oats", "Corn","Oats", "Corn","Oats", "Oats", "Corn","Oats"),
                        Yield = c(23,45,24,40,20,19,41,22),
                        Src   = c("a","a","b","c","a","a","c","a"),
                        stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
df4.long
```

We are missing records for 2001 and Corn, 2003 and Corn, and data for both grains are missing for 2002 and 2004. To add rows for all missing pairs of year/grain values, use the `complete` function. Here, we'll assign `0` to missing `Yield` values and `NA` to the `Src` values.

```{r}
df.all <- complete(df4.long, Year=1999:2005, Grain=  c("Oats", "Corn"),
                   fill = list(Yield = 0, Src = NA))
df.all
```

NOTE 1: The dataframe should be ungrouped using `ungroup()` before calling `complete()` if a `group_by()` operation was previously applied to the table.

NOTE 2: If one of the columns used to complete the set of unique values is a factor, then passing that column name as an argument will automatically create unique sets of values from that factor's *levels.*

If you want to show just the missing rows, use `dplyr::anti_join()`.

```{r}
dplyr::anti_join(df.all, df4.long)
```

### Filling date/time gaps in a table


#### Example using a `Date` object class

This is another example that makes use of the `complete` function. Here, we seek to add missing date/time values in a time series table.

```{r}
df.dt <- data.frame( Date = as.Date(c("2000-01-01", "2000-01-03", "2000-01-05")),
                     Value = c(1,3,5))
```

To fill the missing dates between the minimum and maximum dates in `df.dt`, we first need to create the sequence of dates between these minimum and maximum values.  We could do this in the `complete` function, but it will be clearer to the reader if these operations are performed separately.

```{r}
dates.all <- seq(min(df.dt$Date), max(df.dt$Date), by = "1 day")
```

Next, we pass the complete set of dates, `dates.all` to the `complete` function. We'll assign `NA` to the missing `Value` values.

```{r}
df.dt.all <- complete(df.dt, Date = dates.all, fill = list(Value = NA))
df.dt.all
``` 
The `seq` function used in this example has a special method for `Date` objects. As such, it accepts a unique set of incremental parameters (via the `by =` parameter). In the above example, we are asking the function to increment the date object by `1 day`. Other increments can be applied to a sequenced Date object as shown in the following table.

+-----------------+------------------------------------------+
| Increment units | Description                              |
+=================+==========================================+
| `day`           | *X* number of **days** between dates     |
+-----------------+------------------------------------------+
| `week`          | *X* number of **weeks** between dates    |
+-----------------+------------------------------------------+
| `months`        | *X* number of **months** between dates   |
+-----------------+------------------------------------------+
| `quarter`       | *X* number of **quarters** between dates |
+-----------------+------------------------------------------+
| `year`          | *X* number of **years** between dates    |
+-----------------+------------------------------------------+


#### Example using a `Posix` object class

Recall that if a time element is to be stored in a date, the date object becomes a `Posix` object class. This adds additional increment units to the `seq` function. In the following example, we create a new data frame (with a time value), then fill the table with date/times at 6 hour increments.

```{r}
df.tm <- data.frame( Date = as.POSIXct(c("2000-01-01 18:00 EST", 
                                         "2000-01-02 6:00 EST", 
                                         "2000-01-03 12:00 EST")),
                     Value = c(1,3,5))
```

```{r}
pos.all <- seq(min(df.tm$Date), max(df.tm$Date), by = "6 hour")
```

```{r}
df.tm.all <- complete(df.tm, Date = pos.all, fill = list(Value = NA))
df.tm.all
``` 
In this example the `seq` method for the `Posix` object adds a few more increment units to those available with the `seq.Date` method shown in the previous table. These include: 

+-----------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Increment units | Description                                                                                                |
+=================+============================================================================================================+
| `sec`           | *X* number of **seconds** between timestamps.                                                              |
+-----------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| `min`           | *X* number of **minutes** between timestamps.                                                              |
+-----------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| `hour`          | *X* number of **hours** between timestamps.                                                                |
+-----------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| `DSTday`        | *X* number of **days** between timestamps while taking into account changes to/from daylight savings time. |
+-----------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

### Identifying missing combination in dataframes

In an earlier example, we had the function automatically add the missing combinations using **explicitly** defined ranges of values. If you just want to output the missing combinations from the **existing** set of values in both columns, use the `expand()` function.


```{r}
p.all <- expand(df4.long, Year, Grain) # List all possible combinations
p.all
```

Note that this only outputs the columns of interest. If you need to see the other columns in the output, perform a join.

```{r}
dplyr::left_join(p.all, df4.long, by=c("Year", "Grain"))
```


### Auto-fill down or up

The `fill()` function is used to replace `NA` values with the closest non-`NA` value in a column. For example, to fill *down*, set the `.direction` argument to `"down"`.

```{r}
df5 <- data.frame(Month = 1:12, 
                 Year = c(2000, rep(NA, 4),2001, rep(NA,6)))
df5
fill(df5, Year, .direction="down")
```
