# Data Object Type and Structure

```{r echo=FALSE}
source("libs/Common.R")
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
R_ver(c)
```


## Core data types

These data types, or **modes**, define how the values are stored in the computer. You can get an object's mode using the `typeof()` function. Note that R also has a built-in `mode()` function that will serve the same purpose with the one exception in that it will not distinguish integers from doubles.

### Numeric

The **numeric** data type is probably the simplest. It consists of numbers such as integers (e.g. `1 ,-3 ,33 ,0`) or doubles (e.g. `0.3, 12.4, -0.04, 1.0`). For example, to create a numeric (double) vector we can type:

```{r}
x <- c(1.0, -3.4, 2, 140.1)
mode(x)
```

To assess if the number is stored as an *integer* or a *double* use the `typeof()` function.

```{r}
typeof(x)
```

Note that removing the fraction part of a number when creating a numeric object does not necessarily create an integer. For example, creating what seems to be an integer object returns *double* when queried by `typeof()`:

```{r}
x <- 4
typeof(x)
```

To force R to recognize a value as an integer add an upper case `L` to the number.

```{r}
x <- 4L
typeof(x)
```

### Character

The **character** data type consists of letters or words such as `"a", "f", "project", "house value"`.

```{r}
x <- c("a", "f", "project", "house value")
typeof(x)
```

Characters can also consist of numbers represented as characters. The distinction between a character representation of a number and a numeric one is important. For example, if we have two numeric vectors `x` and `y` such as

```{r}
x <- 3
y <- 5.3
```

and we choose to sum the two variables, we get:

```{r}
x + y
```

If we repeat these steps but instead choose to represent the numbers `3` and `5.3` as characters we get the following error message:

```{r error=TRUE}
x <- "3"
y <- "5.3"
x + y
```

Note the use of quotes to force numbers to character mode.

### Logical

**Logical** values can take on one of two values: `TRUE` or `FALSE`. These can also be represented as `1` or `0`. For example, to create a logical vector of 4 elements, you can type

```{r}
x <- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)
```

or

```{r}
x <- as.logical(c(1,0,0,1))
```

Note that in both cases, `typeof(x)` returns `r typeof(x)`. Also note that the `1`'s and `0`'s in the last example are converted to `TRUE`'s and `FALSE`'s internally.

## Naming R objects

You can use any combination of alphanumeric characters, along with dots and underscores, to name an R object. But there are a few exceptions:

* Names cannot start with a number;
* Names cannot have spaces;
* Names cannot be a standalone number such as `12` or `0.34`;
* Names cannot be a reserved word such as `if`, `else`, `function`, `TRUE`, `FALSE` and `NULL` just to name a few (to see the full list of reserved words, type `?Reserved`).

Examples of valid names include `a`, `dat2`, `cpi_index`, `.tmp`, and even a standalone dot `.` (though a dot can make reading code difficult under certain circumstances).

Examples of invalid names include `1dat`, `dat 2` (note the space between `dat` and `2`), `df-ver2` (the dash is treated as a mathematical operator), and `Inf` (the latter  is a reserved word listed in the `?Reserved` help document).

You *can* mix cases, but use upper cases with caution since some letters look very much the same in both lower and upper cases (e.g. `s` and `S`).


## Derived data types

We've learned that data are stored as either numeric, character or logical, but they can carry additional *attribute* information that allow these objects to be treated in special ways by certain functions in R. These attributes define an object's **class** and can be extracted from that object via the `class()` function. 

### Factor {#factors_xtr}

**Factors** are normally used to group variables into a fixed number of unique categories or **levels**. For example, a dataset may be grouped by gender or month of the year. Such data are usually loaded into R as a numeric or character data type requiring that they be converted to a factor using the `as.factor()` function.

In the following chunk of code, we create a factor from a character object.

```{r}
a      <- c("M", "F", "F", "U", "F", "M", "M", "M", "F", "U")
a.fact <- as.factor(a)
```

Note that `a` is of `character` data type. 

```{r}
typeof(a)
```

However, the derived object `a.fact` is now stored as an `integer`!

```{r}
typeof(a.fact)
```

Yet, when displaying the contents of `a.fact` we see character values. 

```{r}
a.fact
```

How can this be? Well, `a.fact` is a more complicated object than the simple objects created thus far in that the factor is storing additional information not seen in its output. This hidden information is stored in **attributes**. To view these hidden attributes, use the `attributes` function.

```{r}
attributes(a.fact)
```

There are two attributes: `levels` and `class`. The `levels` attribute lists the three unique values in `a.fact`. The order in which these levels are listed reflect their *numeric* representation. So in essence, `a.fact` is storing each value as an integer that points to one of the three unique levels.

![](img/levels1.png)

So why doesn't R output the integer values when we output `a.fact`? To understand why, we first need to know that when we call the object name, R is wrapping that object name with the `print` command, so the following lines of code are identical.

```{r eval = FALSE}
a.fact
print(a.fact)
```

The `print` function then looks for a `class` attribute in the object. The class type instructs the `print` function on how to generate the output. Since `a.fact` has a `factor` class attribute, the `print` function is instructed to replace the integer values with the level "tags". 

Naturally, this all happens behind the scenes without user intervention. 

Another way to determine `a.fact`'s class type is to call the `class` function.

```{r}
class(a.fact)
```

The unique levels of a factor, and the order in which they are stored can be extracted using the `levels` function.

```{r}
levels(a.fact)
```

Remember, the order in which the levels are displayed match their integer representation.

Note that if a class attribute is not present, the `class` function will return the object's data type (though it will not distinguish between integer and double).

```{r}
class(a)
```

In such a case, the object is treated as a generic element.

To appreciate the benefits of a factor we'll first create a dataframe (dataframes are data tables whose structure will be covered later in this tutorial). One column will be assigned  the `a.fact` factor and another will be assigned some random numeric values.

```{r}
x      <- c(166, 47, 61, 148, 62, 123, 232, 98, 93, 110)
dat    <- data.frame(x = x, gender = a.fact)
dat
```

The `gender` column is now a factor with three levels: `F`, `M` and `U`. We can use the `str()` function to view the dataframe's structure as well as its columns classes.

```{r}
str(dat)
```

Many functions other than `print` will recognize factor data types and will allow you to split the output into groups defined by the factor's unique levels. For example, to create three boxplots of the value `x`, one for each gender group `F`, `M` and `U`, type the following:

```{r fig.width = 4, fig.height=2.5,echo=2}
OP <- par( mar=c(2,2,0,0))
boxplot(x ~ gender, dat, horizontal = TRUE)
par(OP)
```

The tilde `~` operator is used in the plot function to split (or *condition*) the data into separate plots based on the factor `gender`.

Factors will prove to be quite useful in many analytical and graphical procedures as we'll see in subsequent sections.

#### Rearranging level order

A factor will define a hierarchy for its levels. When we invoked the `levels` function in the last example, you may have noted that the levels output were ordered `F`, `M` and`U`--this is the level hierarchy defined for `gender` (i.e. `F`>`M`>`U` ). This means that regardless of the order in which the factors appear in a table, anytime a plot or operation is conditioned by the factor, the grouped elements will appear in the order defined by the levels' hierarchy. When we created the boxplot from our `dat` object, the plotting function ordered the boxplot (bottom to top) following `gender`'s level hierarchy (i.e. `F` first, then `M`, then `U`). 

If we wanted the boxplots to be plotted in a different order (i.e. `U` first followed by `F` then `M`) we would need to modify the `gender` column by recreating the factor object as follows:

```{r}
dat$gender <- factor(dat$gender, levels=c("U","F","M"))
str(dat)
```

The `factor` function is given the original factor values (`dat$gender`) but is also given the levels in the new order in which they are to appear(`levels=c("U","F","M")`). Now, if we recreate the boxplot, the plot order (plotted from bottom to top) will reflect the new level hierarchy.


```{r fig.width = 4, fig.height=2.5,echo=2}
OP <- par( mar=c(2,2,0,0))
boxplot(x ~ gender, dat, horizontal = TRUE)
par(OP)
```

#### Subsetting table by level and dropping levels

In this example, we can subset the table by level using the subset function. For example, to subset the values associated with `F` and `M`, type:

```{r}
dat.f <- subset(dat, gender == "F" | gender == "M")
dat.f
```

The double equality sign `==` differs from the single equality sign `=` in that the former asses a condition: it checks if the variable to the left of `==` equals the variable to the right.

However, if you display the levels associated with this new dataframe, you'll still see the level `U` even though it no longer exists in the `gender` column.

```{r}
levels(dat.f$gender)
```

This can be a nuisance when plotting the data subset.

```{r fig.width = 4, fig.height=2.5,echo=2}
OP <- par( mar=c(2,2,0,0))
boxplot(x ~ gender, dat.f, horizontal = TRUE)
par(OP)
```

Even though no records are available for `U`, the plot function allocates a slot for that level. To resolve this, we can use the `droplevels` function to remove all unused levels.

```{r}
dat.f$gender <- droplevels(dat.f$gender)
levels(dat.f$gender)
```

```{r fig.width = 4, fig.height=2,echo=2}
OP <- par( mar=c(2,2,0,0))
boxplot(x ~ gender, dat.f, horizontal = TRUE)
par(OP)
```

### Date

Date values are stored as numbers. But to be properly interpreted as a date object in R, their attribute must be explicitly defined as a **date**. R provides many facilities to convert and manipulate dates and times, but a package called `lubridate` makes working with dates/times much easier. A separate [section](Week02c.html) is dedicated to the creation and manipulation of date objects.

### NA and NULL

You will find that many data files contain missing or unknown  values. It may be tempting to assign these missing or unknown values a `0` but doing so can lead to many undesirable results when analyzing the data. R has two placeholders for such elements: `NA` and `NULL`.

For example, let's say that we made four measurements where the second measurement was not available but we wanted that missing value to be recorded in our table, we would encode that missing value as follows:

```{r}
x <- c(23, NA, 1.2, 5)
```

`NA` (Not Available) is a missing value indicator. It suggests that *a* value should be present but is unknown.

The `NULL` object also represents missing values but its interpretation is slightly  different in that it suggests that the value does not exist or that it's not measurable. 

```{r}
y <- c(23, NULL, 1.2, 5)
```

The difference between `NA` and `NULL` may seem subtle, but their interpretation in some functions can lead to different outcomes. For example, when computing the mean of `x`, R returns an `NA` value:

```{r}
mean(x)
```

This serves as a check to remind the user that one of the elements is missing. This can be overcome by setting the `na.rm` parameter to `TRUE` as in `mean(x, na.rm=T)` in which case R ignores the missing value.

A `NULL` object, on the other hand, is treated differently. Since `NULL` implies that a value *should not* be present, R no longer feels the need to treat such element as questionable and allows the mean value to be computed:

```{r}
mean(y)
```

It's more common to find data tables with missing elements populated with `NA`'s than `NULL`'s so unless you have a specific reason to use `NULL` as a missing value placeholder, use `NA` instead.

#### NA data types

`NA` has different data types. By default, it's a logical variable.

```{r}
typeof(NA)
```

But it can be coerced to other types/classes such as character.

```{r}
typeof( as.character(NA))
```

It can also be coerced to a derived data type such as a date.

```{r}
class( as.Date(NA))
```

Note the use of `class` instead of `typeof` (recall that a date object is stored as a number but has a `Date` class attribute).

Alternatively, you can make use of built-in reserved words such as `NA_character_` and `NA_integer_`. Note that there is no reserved word for an `NA` date type.

```{r}
typeof(NA_character_)
typeof(NA_integer_)
```

The distinction between `NA` types can be important in certain settings. Examples of these will be highlighted in [Week 03](Week03a.html#Conditional-statements).

## Data structures

Most datasets we work with consist of batches of values such as a table of temperature values or a list of survey results. These batches are stored in R in one of several *data structures*. These include **(atomic) vectors**, **matrices**, **data frames** and **lists**.

![](img/data_structures.png)

### (Atomic) Vectors

The **atomic vector** (or **vector** for short) is the simplest data structure in R which consists of an ordered set of values of the same type and or class (e.g. numeric, character, date, etc...). A vector can be created using the *combine* function `c()` as in

```{r}
x <- c(674 , 4186 , 5308 , 5083 , 6140 , 6381)
x
```

A vector object is an indexable collection of values which allows one to access a specific index number. For example, to access the third element of `x`, type:

```{r}
x[3]
```

You can also select a subset of elements by index values using the combine function `c()`.

```{r}
x[c(1,3,4)]
```

Or, if you are interested in a range of indexed values such as index 2 through 4, use the `:` operator.

```{r}
x[2:4]
```

You can also assign new values to a specific index. For example, we can replace the second value in vector `x` with `0`.

```{r}
x[2] <- 0
x
```

Note that a vector can store any data type such as characters.

```{r}
x <- c("all", "b", "olive")
x
```

However, a vector can only be of one type. For example, you cannot mix numeric and character types as follows:

```{r}
x <- c( 1.2, 5, "Rt", "2000")
```

In such a situation, R will convert the element types to the **highest common mode** following the order **NULL < logical < integer < double < character**. In our working example, the elements are coerced to `character`:

```{r}
typeof(x)
```


### Matrices and arrays

Matrices in R can be thought of as vectors indexed using *two* indices instead of one. For example, the following line of code creates a 3 by 3 matrix of randomly generated values. The parameters `nrow` and `ncol` define the matrix dimension and the function `runif()` generates the nine random numbers that populate this matrix.

```{r}
m <- matrix(runif(9,0,10), nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
m
```

If a higher dimension vector is desired, then use the `array()` function to generate the n-dimensional object. A 3x3x3 array can be created as follows:

```{r}
m <- array(runif(27,0,10), c(3,3,3))
m
```


Matrices and arrays can store numeric or character data types, but they cannot store both. This is not to say that you can't have a matrix of the kind

```{r echo=FALSE}
matrix(c("a","b",2,4), nrow=2)
```

but the value `2` and `4` are no longer treated as numeric values but as character values instead.

### Data frames

A **data frame** is what comes closest to our perception of a traditional data *table*. Unlike a matrix, a data frame can *mix* data types across columns (e.g. both numeric and character columns can coexist in a data frame) but data type remains the same across rows. 


```{r}
name   <- c("a1", "a2", "b3")
value1 <- c(23, 4, 12)
value2 <- c(1, 45, 5)
dat    <- data.frame(name, value1, value2)
dat
```

To view each column's data type use the structure `str` function.

```{r}
str(dat)
```

You'll notice that the `value1` and `value2` columns are stored as `numeric` (i.e. as doubles) and not as `integer`. There is some inconsistency in R's characterization of data type. Here, `numeric` represents double whereas an integer datatype would display `integer`. For example: 


```{r}
value2 <- c(1L, 45L, 5L)
dat    <- data.frame(name, value1, value2)
str(dat)
```

Like a vector, elements of a data frame can be accessed by their index (aka subscripts). The first index represents the row number and the second index represents the column number. For example, to list the second row of the third column, type:

```{r}
dat[2, 3]
```

If you wish to list all rows for columns one through two leave the first index blank:

```{r}
dat[ , 1:2 ]
```

or if you wish to list the third row for all columns, leave the second index blank:

```{r}
dat[ 3 , ]
```

You can also reference columns by their names if you append the `$` character to the dataframe object name. For example, to list the values in the column named `value2`, type:

```{r}
dat$value2
```

Dataframes also have attributes:

```{r}
attributes(dat)
```

It's class is `data.frame`. The `names` attribute lists the column names and can be extracted using the `names` function.

```{r}
names(dat)
```

It also has a `row.names` attribute. Since we did not explicitly define row names, R simply  assigned the row number as row names. You can extract the row names using the `rownames` function.

```{r}
rownames(dat)
```

Finally, to get the dimensions of a dataframe (or a matrix), use the `dim()` function.

```{r}
dim(dat)
```

The first value returned by the function represents the number of rows (`r dim(dat)[1]` rows), the second value returned by the function represents the number of columns (`r dim(dat)[2]` columns).

### Lists

A **list** is an ordered set of components stored in a 1D vector.  In fact, it's another kind of vector called a **recursive vector**  where each vector element can be of different data type and *structure*.  This implies that each element of a list can hold complex objects such as matrices, data frames and other list objects too! Think of a list as a single column spreadsheet where each cell stores anything from a number, to a three paragraph sentence, to a five column table. 

A list is constructed using the `list()` function. For example, the following list consists of 3 components: a two-column data frame (tagged as component `A`), a two element logical vector (tagged as component `B`) and a three element character vector (tagged as component `D`).

```{r}
A <- data.frame(
     x = c(7.3, 29.4, 29.4, 2.9, 12.3, 7.5, 36.0, 4.8, 18.8, 4.2),
     y = c(5.2, 26.6, 31.2, 2.2, 13.8, 7.8, 35.2, 8.6, 20.3, 1.1) )
B <- c(TRUE, FALSE)
D <- c("apples", "oranges", "round")

lst <- list(A = A, B = B, D = D)
```

You can view each component's structure using the `str()` function.

```{r}
str(lst)
```

Each component of a list can be extracted using the `$` symbol followed by that component's  name. For example, to access component `A` from list `lst`, type:

```{r}
lst$A
```

You can also access that same component using its *numerical index*. Since `A` is the first component in `lst`, its numerical index is `1`.

```{r}
lst[[1]]
```

Note that we are using **double brackets** to extract `A`. In doing so, we are extracting `A` in its *native data format* (a data frame in this example). Had we used single brackets, `A` would have been extracted as a single component *list* regardless of its native format. The following compares the different data structure outputs between single and double bracketed indices:

```{r}
class(lst[[1]])
class(lst[1])
```

To list the names for each component in a list use the `names()` function:

```{r}
names(lst)
```

Note that components do not require names. For example, we could have created a list as follows (note the omission of `A=`, `B=`, etc...):

```{r}
lst.notags <- list(A, B, D)
```

Listing its contents displays bracketed indices instead of component names.

```{r}
lst.notags
```

When lists do not have component names, the `names()` function will return `NULL`.

```{r}
names(lst.notags)
```

It's usually good practice to assign names to components as these can provide meaningful descriptions of each component.

You'll find that many functions in R return list objects such as the linear regression model function `lm`. For example, run a regression analysis for vector elements `x` and `y` (in data frame `A`) and save the output of the regression analysis to an object called `M`:

```{r}
M <- lm( y ~ x, A)
```

Now let's verify `M`'s data structure. The following shows just the first few lines of the output.

```{r eval=FALSE}
str(M)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, results='hold'}
str(M, list.len = 1)
cat("...")
```

The contents of the regression model object `M` consists of `r length(M)` components which include various diagnostic statistics, regression coefficients, and residuals. Let's extract each component's name:

```{r}
names(M)
```

Fortunately, the regression function assigns descriptive names to each of its components making it easier to figure out what most of these components represent. For example, it's clear that the `residuals` component stores the residual values from the regression model.

```{r}
M$residuals
```

The `M` list is more complex than the simple list `lst` we created earlier. In addition to having more components, it stores a *wider range* of data types and structures. For example, element `qr` is itself a list of five elements!

```{r}
str(M$qr)
```

So if we want to access the element `rank` in the component `qr` of list `M`, we can type:

```{r}
M$qr$rank
```

If we want to access `rank` using indices instead, and noting that `qr` is  the 7^th^ component in list `M` and that `rank` is the 5th element in list `qr` we type:

```{r}
M[[7]][[5]]
```

This should illustrate the value in assigning names to list components; not only do the double brackets clutter the expression, but finding the element numbers can be daunting in a complex list structure.

## Coercing data from one type to another

Data can be coerced from one type to another. For example, to coerce the following vector object from character to numeric, use the `as.numeric()` function.

```{r}
y   <- c("23.8", "6", "100.01","6")
y.c <- as.numeric(y)
y.c
```

The `as.numeric` function forces the vector to a double (you could have also used the `as.double` function). If you convert `y` to an integer, R will remove all fractional parts of the number.

```{r}
as.integer(y)
```

To convert a number to a character use `as.character()`.

```{r}
numchar <- as.character(y.c)
numchar
```

You can also coerce a number or character to a factor.

```{r}
numfac <- as.factor(y)
numfac
charfac <- as.factor(y.c)
charfac
```

There are many other coercion functions in R, a summary of some the most common ones we'll be using in this course follows:

+-----------------------------+-------------------------+
|as.character()               | Convert to character    |
+-----------------------------+-------------------------+
|as.numeric() or as.double()  | Convert to double       |
+-----------------------------+-------------------------+
|as.integer()                 | Convert to integer      |
+-----------------------------+-------------------------+
|as.factor()                  | Convert to factor       |
+-----------------------------+-------------------------+
|as.logical()                 | Convert to a Boolean    |
+-----------------------------+-------------------------+


### A word of caution when converting from factors 

If you need to coerce a factor whose levels represent characters to a `character` data type, use the `as.character()` function.

```{r}
char <- as.character(charfac)
class(char)
```

Numbers stored as factors can also be coerced back to numbers, but be careful, the following will not produce the expected output:

```{r}
num <- as.numeric(numfac)
num
```

The output does not look like a numeric representation of the original elements in `y`. Instead it lists the integers that *point* to the set of unique **levels** (see the earlier section on [factors](#factors_xtr)). To see the *unique* levels in `numfac`, type:

```{r}
levels(numfac)
```

There are three unique values in our vector. Recall that the order in which the levels appear in the above output represents the ordered *pointer* values. So `1` points to level `100.01`, `2` points to level `23.8`, and `3` points to level `6`. 

So, to extract the actual values (and not the pointers), you must first convert the factor to character before converting to a numeric vector.

```{r}
num <- as.numeric(as.character(numfac))
num

```

## Adding metadata to objects

Earlier, you were introduced to object attributes. Attributes can be thought of as ancillary information attached to a data object's header. In other words, it is not part of the set of values stored in the object. If one or more attributes is/are present in the data object, they can be revealed using the `attributes` command. We already explored the attributes associated with a `factor` object. For example. `a.fact` has two attributes: `levels` and `class`.


```{r}
attributes(a.fact)
```

If an attribute is not explicitly defined for a data object, then a `NULL` is returned.

```{r}
attributes(a)
```

You can create your own attribute name, but it's best to avoid attribute names commonly used in R such as `class`, `dim`, `dimnames`, `names`, `row.names`. 

An object's attribute is usually a part of a data object that a user does not need to explictly deal with, but it can be leveraged to store metadata (data documentation). R  has a reserved attribute name, `comment`, that can be used for this purpose. You can add this attribute using the `attr` function.

```{r}
attr(a, "comment")  <- "a batch of character values"
```

Note that R has a special function for the comment attribute which can be used to extract the comment attribute value.


```{r}
comment(a) 
```

You can also use the `comment` function to set the comment value.

```{r}
comment(a) <- "comment added using the comment function"
comment(a) 
```

You can, of course, create your own attribute. For example, to create an attribute named `dim.units` and assigning it the value `"meters"` to the object `y.c` created earlier in this tutorial, type:

```{r}
attr(y.c, "dim.units") <-  "meters"
```


Note that many R packages will also implement their own set of attribute names. So you should familiarize yourself with the packages used in a worklfow before defining your own attribute name.
