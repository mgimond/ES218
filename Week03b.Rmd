# Introduction

Data tables come in different sizes and shape; they can be a very simple two column dataset or they can consist of many columns and "sub-columns". Understanding its structure, and learning how to reshape it into a workable form is critical to an effective and error free analysis.

For example, a median earnings data table downloaded from the U.S. census bureau's website might look something like this:

![A typical table](img/Typical_table.png)

We are conditioned to think of a table as consisting of three components: rows, columns and data values. Implicit in this paradigm is that each column represents a unique attribute. However, this may not always be the case. For example, in the above table, each column represents two distinct variables: gender and educational attainment (two distinct sets of attributes).

Another way of describing a dataset is by defining its **variable(s)**, **values** and **observations**. In the above example, we have four variables: gender, education, region and income. Each variable consists of either categorical values (e.g. region, gender and education) or numerical values (income). 

An observation consists of a **unique set** of attribute **values**. For example the values `West Region`, `Female`, `Graduate` and `$57,914` make up **one** observation: there is just one instance of these combined values in the data. This perspective affords us another option in presenting the dataset: we can assign each column its own variable, and each row its own observation.

Note that each row of the table is part of a unique set of variable attributes. A dataset in this format may not be human "readable" (unlike its *wide* counterpart), but is the format of choice for many data analysis and visualization operations.

The next sections will demonstrate how one can convert a wide format to a long format and *vice versa*.

# Wide and long table formats

A 2014 Boston (Logan airport) flight data summary table will be used in this exercise. The summary displays average mean delay time (in minutes) by day of the work week and quarter. 

```{r tidy=FALSE}

df <- data.frame( Weekday = c( "Mon", "Tues", "Wed", "Thurs", "Fri" ),
                  Q1      = c(  9.9 ,  4.9	,  8.8 ,   12.2 ,  12.2 ),
                  Q2      = c(  5.4	,  9.7  , 11.1 ,   10.2 ,   8.1 ),
                  Q3      = c(  8.8 ,  7.9  , 10.2 ,   9.2  ,   7.9 ),
                  Q4      = c(  6.9 ,    5  ,  9.3 ,   9.7  ,   5.6 ) )
```

Reshaping a table involves modifying its layout (or "shape"). In our example, `df` is in a "wide" format.

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis', warning=FALSE}
knitr::kable(df)
#pander::pandoc.table(df, justify = 'right')
#dplyr::tbl_df(df)
```

There are three unique variables: day of week, quarter of year, and mean departure delay.

## Creating a long table from a wide table

A package that facilitates converting from wide to long (and *vice versa*)  is `tidyr`. To go from wide to long, we use the `gather` function and from long to wide, we use the `spread` function.

The `gather` function takes three arguments: 

 * `key`: This is the name of the new column which will combine all column variables (e.g. `Q1`, `Q2`, `Q3` and `Q4`).
 * `value`: This is the name of the new column which will list all values (e.g. average delay times) associated with each variable combination (e.g. `Mon` and `Q1`, `Tues` and `Q1`, etc...)
 * The third parameter does not have a name, but is a list of columns that are to be collapsed. The column can be referenced by column number or column name. Note that the column enumeration does not need be wrapped in a `c()` function.
 
In our example, the line of code needed to re-express the table into a long form can be written in one of three ways:
 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyr)
df.l <- gather(df, key = "Quarter", value = "Delay" , Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 )
# or
df.l <- gather(df, key = "Quarter", value = "Delay" ,  2:5           )
# or
df.l <- gather(df, key = "Quarter", value = "Delay" ,  -Weekday      )
```

All three lines produce the same output, they differ only by how we are referencing the columns that are to be collapsed. Note that we assigned the names `Quarter` and `Delay` to the two new columns.

The first 10 lines of the output table are shown here. Note how each `Delay` value has its own row.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(tidyr)
df.l <- gather(df, key = "Quarter", value = "Delay" , Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 )
head(df.l, 10)
```

The following figure summarizes the wide to long conversion.

## Creating a wide table from a long table

If a table is to be used for a visual assessment of the values, a long format may be difficult to work with. A long table can be re-expressed into a wide form by picking the two variables that will define the new unique rows and columns. 

Continuing with our example, we will convert `df.l` back to a wide format.

```{r}
df.w <-  spread( df.l ,   key = Quarter  ,   value = Delay  ) 
```

We've now recreated the wide version of our table.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(tidyr)
df.l <- gather(df, key = "Quarter", value = "Delay" , Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 )
head(df.w, 10)
```

The following figure summarizes the wide to long conversion.

# Combining elements from many columns into a single column

Another practical function in the `tidyr` package is `unite()`. It combines columns into a single column by chaining the contents of the combined columns. For example, the following table has hours, minutes and seconds in separate columns.

```{r}
library(tidyr)
df <- data.frame(
      Index = c( 1,2,3),
      Hour = c(2,14,20),
      Min = c(34,2,55),
      Sec = c(55, 17, 23))

df
```

To combine the three time elements into a single column, type:

```{r}
df2 <- unite(df,  col = Time , 2:4, sep=":", remove=TRUE)
df2
```

The `col` parameter defines the new column name; the paremeter `2:4` tells `unite` that columns two through four are to be combined into column `Time`; `sep=":"` tells the function what characters are to be used to separate the elements (here, we are separating the time elements using `:`); `remove=TRUE` tells the function to remove columns two through four.

# Separating elements in one column into separate columns

The reverse of `unite()` is `separate()`. Continuing with the last example, if we want to split the time elements into their respective columns, type:

```{r}
df3 <-  separate(df2,  col = Time , c("Hour", "Minute", "Second"), sep=":", remove=TRUE)
df3
```

You will recognize many of the parameters from the `unite` function with one difference: the new (to be created) column names need to be defined in a combine, `c()`, statement.

# Filling gaps in a table using `complete`

It's not uncommon to be handed a table with incomplete combinations of observations. For example, the following table gives us yield and data source values for each combination of year and grain type. However, several combinations of year/grain are missing.

```{r}
df <- data.frame( Year  = c(1999,1999,2000,2000,2001,2003,2003,2005),
                  Grain = c("Oats", "Corn","Oats", "Corn","Oats", "Oats", "Corn","Oats"),
                  Yield = c(23,45,24,40,20,19,41,22),
                  Src   = c("a","a","b","c","a","a","c","a"))
df
```

For example, we do not have records for `2001` and `Corn`, `2003` and `Corn`, and data for both grains are missing for `2002` and `2004`. To add rows for all missing pairs of year/grain values, use the `complete` function.

```{r}
df.all <- complete(df, Year=1999:2005, Grain=c("Oats", "Corn"), fill=list(Yield=NA,Src=NA))
df.all
```

The function allows you to define the full range of expected values for `year` and `Grain`; the function will then create all pair combinations and add those pairs that are missing to the table. For all missing pairs, the function allows the user to define the missing values to assign to the `Yield` and `Src` variables (here, we choose to assign `NA` values to each).

Note that the `combine` function can be used with one or more columns in a table.
